# upcat-mock_tests

hi! this is a little summer project of mine to help me prepare for my upcoming CETs while practicing my programming skills. throughout the process, i used the help of chatgpt so some parts might be a bit off (aka i havent manually checked ALL the questions myself, but suffice they're all marked correctly). anyways, i hope this helps!!
